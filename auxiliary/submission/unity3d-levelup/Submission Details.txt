<br>
LevelUp encourages better game design with a rich object domain of:<br>
- Worlds<br>
- Levels<br>
- Scores<br>
- Records<br>
- Gates<br>
- Missions<br>
- Rewards<br>
<br>
Use our simple events API to get notified when the player has passed a level, reached a high score, completed a mission, earned a reward, etc.
Also, an encrypted on-device storage will keep the user's game state even after closing the game. SOOMLA for Unity is available for <strong>iOS and Android</strong>.
